            Please note that all retainer and add-on hour tiers cover a range of services including development work, support, and meetings. 
            Retainer hours are essentially a reservation of time, and you pay for the reservation of this time, 
            ensuring dedicated availability for your project needs. 
            The hours purchased within any tier are cumulative and account for the total time spent on all project-related activities, 
            encompassing coding, troubleshooting, as well as consultation and strategy meetings. 
            This approach allows us to use the allocated time efficiently, maximizing the value and progress of your project. 
            We are committed to maintaining transparency and open communication about the allocation of hours to ensure mutual understanding and satisfaction. 
            Retainer hours guarantee that we reserve specific amounts of time exclusively for your project, 
            emphasizing our commitment to its success. 
            For any specific questions or concerns about how hours are allocated or the reservation of time through retainers, 
            please feel free to contact us directly.
