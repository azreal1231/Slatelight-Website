            Please note that all retainer and add-on hour tiers cover a range of services including development work, support, and meetings. 
            The hours purchased within any tier are cumulative and account for the total time spent on all project-related activities, 
            encompassing coding, troubleshooting, as well as consultation and strategy meetings. 
            We strive to use this time efficiently to maximize the value and progress of your project. 
            It is our policy to maintain transparency and open communication about the allocation of hours to ensure mutual understanding and satisfaction. 
            For any specific questions or concerns about how hours are allocated, please feel free to contact us directly.
